# Saber Modpack Manager (SMM)

## About
<p>
The aim of this project is to create a Minecraft modpack management system comparable to the
<a href="https://www.example.com">FTB</a> and <a href="https://www.example.com">Technic</a>
launchers. It consists of several sub-systems, including a client program (
<a href="https://www.example.com">GUI</a> and <a href="https://www.example.com">CLI versions</a>
) for downloading, installing, and managing their installed modpacks, an
<a href="https://www.example.com">authentication API</a>
for users to log in to their SMM accounts, a
<a href="https://www.example.com">RESTful API</a> for the server functions, and a
<a href="https://www.example.com">website</a> for modpack documentation, mod help,
mod author accreditation, and user account management.
