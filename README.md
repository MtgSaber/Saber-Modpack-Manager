# Saber Modpack Manager (SMM)

## About
<p>
The aim of this project is to create a Minecraft modpack management system comparable to the  
<a href="example.com">FTB</a> and <a href="example.com">Technic</a>  
launchers. It consists of several sub-systems, including a client program (  
<a href="example.com">GUI</a> and <a href="example.com">CLI versions</a>  
) for downloading, installing, and managing their installed modpacks, an  
<a href="example.com">authentication API</a>  
for users to log in to their SMM accounts, a  
<a href="example.com">RESTful API</a> for the server functions, and a  
<a href="example.com">website</a> for modpack documentation, mod help,  
mod author accreditation, and user account management.
